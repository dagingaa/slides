note:
- So there is a guy called feross that has started on a full web version of a torrent client
- Completely modular, and if you've been to other conferences this year, you've
  probably seen those libraries used elsewhere as well
- The project is in alpha, might not work, but promises to deliver a full web
  version of a torrent client
- But still, these are rpetty obvious use cases for p2p, how about somehting original?
