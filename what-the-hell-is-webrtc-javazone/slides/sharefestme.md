note:
- THis is a service called sharefest.me, which I ahve used a lot
- Anonymous, secure p2p file transfers from the browser
- Just enter sharefest, drag and drop the file you want to share, for example a presentation
- You get a link, send it to someone, and they can download your file
- There are no file size limits, it uses your local network if you are on one,
  it doesn't snoop on your files, you don't upload anything to their servers
- But since we're talking about p2p file transfwer, you can't not think about torrents.
