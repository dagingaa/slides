note:
- The most obvious sue case, and what it was created for was video conferencing.
- THis is appear.in, you can type appear.in/ANYTHING, and get a room where your
  friends can talk with audio/video
- People don't get how easy it is, just send the URL, they click it, and you
  are talking, no registration or login needed
- This is actually pretty cool, because this is 6 HD streams being transmitted to
each peer in a full mesh network, where two of the clients are iPhones. And it
works!
- But as I said, it's not only about video/audio...
