note:
- Welcome to this talk
- I'm so happy so many could join us today, even if it's getting kinda late in the conference
- Before we begin, a short cencus
    - How many have heard of WebRTC before coming here?
    - How many use a product based on WebRTC (if you know)?
    - And how many work on a WebRTC project?
- Alright, let's begin by me introducing myself.
