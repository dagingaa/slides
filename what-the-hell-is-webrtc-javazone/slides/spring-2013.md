note:
- After a year of experimenting, WebRTC was finally ready to hit the masses. In
  Spring 2013 WebRTC hit Chrome stable, and the first consumer WebRTC services
  launched.
- Spring 2013 also marked the first time we had full interoperability between
  browsers (and two different implementations of the spec) between Firefox and
  Chrome
