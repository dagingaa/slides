note:
- Let's move over to gaming, this is bananabread, a project from Mozilla to
  create a FPS in the browser
- But you can't hav ean FPS without multiplayer, but Mozilla didn't want to
  host game session
- Uses WebRTC to achieve p2p multiplayer, let's just look at the video of how
  well this works
- Looks very Quakey, and the tech bit of it is really cool
