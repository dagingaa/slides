note:
- The most obvious one is WebRTC in communications, since it is mainly a
  technology for communicatons
- WebRTC makes it easier for anyone to test out new theories
- It just provides a high level abstraction away from all the pain points to
  make it easier to set up a communication channels
- Especially useful for synchronous communication, which is almost gone in
  today's communication space
- Explain async, messaging etc.
- Give example sof synchronous communication
- It will spawn a wave of new serves that makes synchronous communications easy
  and desirable again
- See it as a pendulum
