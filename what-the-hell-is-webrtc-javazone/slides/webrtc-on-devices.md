##  WebRTC on devices

![appear.in on iPhone](img/iphone.png)

note:
- Everything is not doom and gloom, there is WebRTC on iOS
- Libraries for ObjectiveC, Java and C++. Support on iOS, Android and Qt WebEngine
- Server-side support, did a tech demo of face detection in an appear.in room from a Java instance
- Tech demo of a live transcribing and translating service on top of WebRTC
- But even so, we are faced with some challenges...
