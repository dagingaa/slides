##  May 2011

#### <span class="highlight">WebRTC is open sourced by Google</span>

note:
- Back before May 2011, Google was looking at the current state-of-affairs for
  browsers vs. desktop, looking at how they could improve the web platform to
  have the capabilities that the desktop platform could provide.
- One thing they couldn't figure out, was how to make video calls in the
  browser easier
- So Google does as big companies do, they bought a company, and in May 2011,
  they open sourced the first version of WebRTC, and started working on a draft
  specification
