##  Unfinished spec

#### <span class="highlight">Interoperability breaks between different browser versions</span>


note:
- Constantly have to check your code for correctness
- Always have to test new browser releases for undocumented breaking changes
- Lots of bugs
- Browsers are not standards compliant yet, and can even break between major
  versions (like 36 -> 37 for screen sharing)
- Not something you can outsource to some consultancy, set it and forget it,
  needs babysitting
