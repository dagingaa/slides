note:
- All of the demos I've shown you so far are tech demos more than anything,
  well, except appear.in, but how well is WebRTC suited for the masses?
- Snapchat launced earlier this year live video support, where users could
  connect to each other and transfer a live video feed of themselves.
- How many have tried it?
- For those that haven't, it works like this: If both parties are in a chat
  together at the same time, a little blue orb lights up, enticing you to touch
  it. Once you touch and hold, you transfer a live video feed to the other
  persons phone, covering their entire screen. If the other person wants to
  respond, they can simply touch and hold their blue orb to transfer themselves
  to you, within a second.
- So I guess what I'm trying to say here is...
