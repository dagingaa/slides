##  At almost <span class="highlight">no cost</span> to you

note:
- And the best of all, this comes at almost no cost to you, as a developer
- In the first year, and throughout our growth we only spent between $200-$400

  ramping up our capacity, but it's still pocket change
- So by now you're probably asking...
