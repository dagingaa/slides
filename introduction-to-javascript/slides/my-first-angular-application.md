##  My first Angular application

````html
<div ng-app>
<label>Name:</label>
<input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here">
<hr>
<h1>Hello { { yourName } }!</h1>
</div>
````
<small>Markdown doesn't like { } right next to each other</small>

note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
