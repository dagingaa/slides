##  Let's create: Collatz Conjecture

![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png)

<small>Take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is
odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process
indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you
will always eventually reach 1.</small>
