##  One-way data bindings

<small>Source: http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding</small>

note:
- Most templating systems only bind data in one direction
- You have your model and your template
- Do this one time merge and get your View
- Changes to the model are NOT automatically reflected in the view
- Any changes the user makes are not automatically reflected in the model
- Need to write code to constantly keep things in sync
