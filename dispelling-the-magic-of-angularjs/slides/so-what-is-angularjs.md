##  So, what is AngularJS?

note:
- See if you can skip this part if you are number two
- A JavaScript framework that extends HTML, teaches the browser new syntax
- What HTML would be like if it was designed for building applications
- Built with testing in mind!
- It is opinionated, but aims for those opinions to be a starting point rather
  than law
- DI and IoC
- Frees you from:
    - manipulating the DOM programatically
    - registering callback
    - marshalling data to and from the UI
    - writing tons of initialisation code just to get started
- What we are gonna do today is dissect some of the magic behind the scenes
